                <p><b>Daniel Gerhard</b> Brown (born June 22, 1964) is an American
                author best known for his thriller novels, including the Robert
                Langdon novels Angels & Demons (2000), The Da Vinci Code (2003),
                The Lost Symbol (2009), Inferno (2013), and Origin (2017). His
                novels are treasure hunts that usually take place over a period of
                24 hours. They feature recurring themes of cryptography, art, and
                conspiracy theories. His books have been translated into 57 languages
                and, as of 2012, have sold over 200 million copies. Three of them,
                Angels & Demons, The Da Vinci Code, and Inferno, have been adapted
                into films, while one of them, The Lost Symbol, was adapted into a
                television show.</p>
                <p>The Robert Langdon novels are deeply engaged with Christian themes
                and historical fiction, and have generated controversy as a result.
                Brown states on his website that his books are not anti-Christian and
                he is on a "constant spiritual journey" himself. He states that his
                book The Da Vinci Code is "an entertaining story that promotes spiritual
                discussion and debate" and suggests that the book may be used "as a positive
                    catalyst for introspection and exploration of our faith."</p>

            <div class="title" id="early-life-title">Early life</div>
            <div class="early-life-text">
                <p>Daniel Gerhard Brown was born on June 22, 1964, in Exeter, New Hampshire.
                He has a younger sister, Valerie (born 1968) and brother, Gregory (born 1974).
                Brown attended Exeter's public schools until the ninth grade. He grew up on
                the campus of Phillips Exeter Academy, where his father, Richard G. Brown,
                was a teacher of mathematics and wrote textbooks from 1968 until his retirement
                in 1997. His mother, Constance (née Gerhard), trained as a church organist and
                student of sacred music. Brown was raised an Episcopalian, and described his
                religious evolution in a 2009 interview:
                <div class="citata">
                    <p>"I was raised Episcopalian, and I was very religious as a kid. Then, in
                        eighth or ninth grade, I studied astronomy, cosmology, and the origins
                        of the universe. I remember saying to a minister, 'I don't get it. I
                        read a book that said there was an explosion known as the Big Bang, but
                        here it says God created heaven and Earth and the animals in seven days.
                        Which is right?' Unfortunately, the response I got was, 'Nice boys don't
                        ask that question.' A light went off, and I said, 'The Bible doesn't make
                        sense. Science makes much more sense to me.' And I just gravitated away
                        from religion."</p>
                </div>
                When asked in the same interview about his then-current religious views, Brown
                replied:
                <div class="citata">
                    "The irony is that I've really come full circle. The more science I studied,
                    the more I saw that physics becomes metaphysics and numbers become imaginary
                    numbers. The further you go into science, the mushier the ground gets. You start
                    to say, 'Oh, there is an order and a spiritual aspect to science.'"
                </div>
                <p>Brown's interest in secrets and puzzles stems from their presence in his household
                as a child, where codes and ciphers were the linchpin tying together the mathematics,
                music, and languages in which his parents worked. The young Brown spent hours working
                out anagrams and crossword puzzles, and he and his siblings participated in elaborate
                treasure hunts devised by their father on birthdays and holidays. On Christmas, for example,
                Brown and his siblings did not find gifts under the tree, but followed a treasure map with
                codes and clues throughout their house and even around town to find the gifts. Brown's
                relationship with his father inspired that of Sophie Neveu and Jacques Saunière in The Da
                Vinci Code, and Chapter 23 of that novel was inspired by one of his childhood treasure hunts.</p>
                <p>After graduating from Phillips Exeter, Brown attended Amherst College, where he was a member of
                    Psi Upsilon fraternity. He played squash, sang in the Amherst Glee Club, and was a writing student
                    of visiting novelist Alan Lelchuk. Brown spent the 1985 school year abroad in Seville, Spain, where
                    he was enrolled in an art history course at the University of Seville. Brown graduated from Amherst
                    in 1986.</p>
            </div>


            <div class="title" id="career-title">Career</div>
            <div class="career-text">
                <p><b class="tt">Composer and singer</b><br>
                After graduating from Amherst, Brown dabbled with a musical career, creating effects with a
                synthesizer, and self-producing a children's cassette entitled SynthAnimals, which included a
                collection of tracks such as "Happy Frogs" and "Suzuki Elephants"; it sold a few hundred copies.
                The music has been compared to Gary Glitter. He then formed his own record company called Dalliance,
                and in 1990 self-published a CD entitled Perspective, targeted to the adult market, which also sold a
                few hundred copies. In 1991 he moved to Hollywood to pursue a career as singer-songwriter and pianist.
                To support himself, he taught classes at Beverly Hills Preparatory School.</p>
                <p>He also joined the National Academy of Songwriters and participated in many of its events.
                    It was there that he met his wife, Blythe Newlon, who was the academy's Director of Artist
                    Development. Though it was not officially part of her job, she took on the seemingly unusual
                    task of helping to promote Brown's projects; she wrote press releases, set up promotional events,
                    and put him in contact with people who could be helpful to his career. She and Brown also developed
                    a personal relationship, though this was not known to all of their associates until 1993, when
                    Brown moved back to New Hampshire, and it was learned that Newlon would accompany him. They married
                    in 1997, at Pea Porridge Pond, near Conway, New Hampshire. In 1994 Brown released a CD titled
                    Angels & Demons. Its artwork was the same ambigram by artist John Langdon which he later used for
                    the novel Angels & Demons. The liner notes also again credited his wife for her involvement,
                    thanking her "for being my tireless cowriter, coproducer, second engineer, significant other, and
                    therapist". The CD included songs such as "Here in These Fields" and the religious ballad,
                    "All I Believe".</p>
                <p>Brown and his wife Blythe moved to Rye, New Hampshire in 1993. Brown became an English teacher at
                    his alma mater Phillips Exeter, and gave Spanish classes to 6th, 7th, and 8th graders at Lincoln
                    Akerman School, a small school for K–8th grade with about 250 students, in Hampton Falls.</p>
                <p>Brown has written a symphonic work titled Wild Symphony which is supplemented by a book of the same
                    name. The book is illustrated by Hungarian artist Susan Batori which feature simple ambigrams for
                    children, while the visuals trigger the corresponding music in an accompanying app. The music was
                    recorded by the Zagreb Festival Orchestra and will receive its world concert premiere by the
                    Portsmouth Symphony Orchestra in 2020. On March 30, 2022, it was announced that Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer
                    and Weed Road Pictures will turn Wild Symphony into an animated musical feature film in the vein of
                    Walt Disney's Fantasia, with Brown writing the screenplay and songs, and Akiva Goldsman producing.</p>
                <p><b class="tt">Writing</b><br>
                While on vacation in Tahiti in 1993, Brown read Sidney Sheldon's novel The Doomsday Conspiracy, and was
                    inspired to become a writer of thrillers.</p>
                <p>He started work on Digital Fortress, setting much of it in Seville, where he had studied in 1985.
                    He also co-wrote a humor book with his wife, 187 Men to Avoid: A Survival Guide for the Romantically
                    Frustrated Woman, under the pseudonym "Danielle Brown". The book's author profile reads,
                    "Danielle Brown currently lives in New England: teaching school, writing books, and avoiding men."
                    The copyright to the book is attributed to Brown.</p>
                <p>In 1996 Brown quit teaching to become a full-time writer. Digital Fortress was published in 1998.
                    His wife Blythe did much of the book's promotion, writing press releases, booking Brown on talk
                    shows, and setting up press interviews. A few months later, Brown and his wife released The
                    Bald Book, another humor book. It was officially credited to his wife, though a representative of
                    the publisher said that it was primarily written by Brown. Brown subsequently wrote Angels & Demons
                    and Deception Point, released in 2000 and 2001 respectively, the former of which was the first to
                    feature the lead character, Harvard symbology expert Robert Langdon. Brown's first three novels
                    had little success, with fewer than 10,000 copies in each of their first printings. His fourth
                    novel, The Da Vinci Code, became a bestseller, going to the top of the New York Times Best Seller
                    list during its first week of release in 2003. It is one of the most popular books of all time,
                    with 81 million copies sold worldwide as of 2009. Its success has helped push sales of Brown's
                    earlier books.</p>
                <p>In 2004 all four of his novels were on the New York Times list in the same week, and, in 2005,
                    he made Time magazine's list of the 100 Most Influential People of the Year. Forbes magazine
                    placed Brown at No. 12 on their 2005 "Celebrity 100" list, and estimated his annual income at
                    US$76.5 million. According to the article published in The Times, the estimated income of Brown
                    after Da Vinci Code sales is $250 million. Brown's third novel featuring Robert Langdon, The Lost
                    Symbol, was released on September 15, 2009. According to the publisher, on its first day the book
                    sold over one million in hardcover and e-book versions in the US, the UK and Canada, prompting the
                    printing of 600,000 hardcover copies in addition to the five million first printing.</p>
                <p>The story takes place in Washington D.C. over a period of twelve hours, and features the Freemasons.
                    The book also includes many elements that made The Da Vinci Code a number one best seller.</p>
                <p>Brown's promotional website states that puzzles hidden in the book jacket of The Da Vinci Code,
                    including two references to the Kryptos sculpture at CIA Headquarters in Langley, Virginia,
                    give hints about the sequel. Brown has adopted a relevant theme in some of his earlier work.</p>
                <p>Brown's fourth novel featuring Robert Langdon, Inferno is a mystery thriller novel released on May
                    14, 2013, by Doubleday. It ranked No. 1 on the New York Times Best Seller list for the first 11
                    weeks of its release, has sold more than 1.4 million copies in the US alone.</p>
                <p>In a 2006 interview, Brown stated that he had ideas for about 12 future books featuring Robert Langdon.</p>
                <p>Characters in Brown's books are often named after real people in his life. Robert Langdon is named
                    after John Langdon, the artist who created the ambigrams used for the Angels & Demons CD and novel.
                    Camerlengo Carlo Ventresca is named after On a Claire Day cartoonist friend Carla Ventresca. In
                    the Vatican archives, Langdon recalls a wedding of two people named Dick and Connie, which are the
                    names of his parents. Robert Langdon's editor Jonas Faukman is named after Brown's real life editor
                    Jason Kaufman. Brown also said that characters were based on a New Hampshire librarian, and a French
                    teacher at Exeter, André Vernet. Cardinal Aldo Baggia, in Angels & Demons, is named after Aldo
                    Baggia, instructor of modern languages at Phillips Exeter Academy.</p>
                <p>In interviews, Brown has said his wife, Blythe, is an art historian and painter. When they met, she
                    was the Director of Artistic Development at the National Academy for Songwriters in Los Angeles.
                    During the 2006 lawsuit over alleged copyright infringement in The Da Vinci Code, information was
                    introduced at trial that showed that Blythe did research for the book. In one article, she was
                    described as "chief researcher".</p>
                <p>Doubleday published his seventh book, Origin, on October 3, 2017. It is the fifth book in his Robert
                    Langdon series.</p>
                <p>Brown's prose style has been criticized as clumsy, with The Da Vinci Code being described as
                    'committing style and word choice blunders in almost every paragraph'. In his 2005 documentary for
                    Channel 4, The Real Da Vinci Code, author and presenter Tony Robinson criticised both the accuracy
                    of the author's historic research and the writing itself, considering the book to be not particularly
                    well written. Much of the criticism was centered on Brown's claim in his preface that the novel is
                    based on fact in relation to Opus Dei and the Priory of Sion, and that "all descriptions of artwork,
                    architecture, documents and secret rituals in [the] novel are accurate".</p>
